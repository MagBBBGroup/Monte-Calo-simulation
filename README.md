This script performs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of a Type II error, aiming to determine the angle of rotation and probability threshold at which changes in the directional movement of birds can be reliably detected under various experimental conditions. By varying the experimental parameters, the simulation helps assess at what angles and probabilities a shift in bird orientation becomes statistically detectable, thereby refining our understanding of the sensitivity and reliability of detection in magnetoreception experiments. author - Fyodor Cellariyus (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fyodor-Cellarius)
